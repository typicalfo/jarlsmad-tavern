is a chat-based multi-user dungeon (MUD) game set in a Viking-inspired world called Jarlheim, featuring five factions, each with five houses and interrelated bloodlines. The game uses AI agents powered by Venice AI (venice-uncensored model) to manage gameplay, NPCs, and dynamic world events, replacing traditional coded logic for flexibility. It is built on the Tanstack Start template, modified for a chat interface, and hosted on Netlify. Data storage includes Upstash Vector for world lore documents, Convex for player statuses, inventories, locations, and agents, Clerk for authentication, and Upstash Redis for real-time chats (world, faction, house, bloodline, and location-based). New players start in a tutorial on a Viking longship, where character creation occurs via chat interactions with NPCs, allowing selection or assignment of faction, house, and bloodline for population balance. All interactions are chat-driven in a single shared instance. Standard game items (weapons, armor, etc.) are stored in Convex. The project is developed live on streams to X (Twitter), Twitch, and YouTube, with code built manually or using Claude for assistance.
